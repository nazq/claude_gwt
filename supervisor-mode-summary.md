# Supervisor Mode Implementation

## What Changed

### 1. Fixed Branch Display
- Removed "refs/heads/" prefix from branch names
- Now shows clean names: `main`, `tests` instead of `refs/heads/main`

### 2. Added Supervisor Mode
- New menu option when in parent directory: "👨‍💼 Enter supervisor mode"
- This launches the Claude wrapper for the master orchestrator
- Uses term "supervisor" instead of "master" to avoid conflicts with branches named "master"

### 3. Updated Menu Structure
When in parent directory:
```
? What would you like to do?
❯ 👨‍💼 Enter supervisor mode      <-- NEW: Direct access to orchestrator
  ➕ Create new branch
  📋 List all branches
  🚀 Work in branch
  🗑️ Remove branch
  🤖 View Claude instances
  🚪 Exit
```

### 4. Session Management
In the Claude wrapper, `:list` now shows:
```
=== Claude Sessions ===
  [0] supervisor (orchestrator)
  [1] main
  [2] tests
  [3] feature-auth
```

Users can:
- `:s 0` or `:s supervisor` - Switch to supervisor
- `:s 1` or `:s main` - Switch to main branch
- `:s` alone - Return to supervisor

### 5. Improved Detection
- Recognizes existing claude-gwt projects (with .bare structure)
- No longer shows "not a git repository" error for existing setups

## Workflow

1. **From parent directory**: Select "Enter supervisor mode" to orchestrate
2. **From supervisor**: Use `:l` to see all sessions, `:s` to switch between them
3. **Broadcast**: From supervisor, use `:b message` to send to all children
4. **Branch work**: Select "Work in branch" to enter a specific branch context

## Benefits

- Direct access to orchestrator without cd'ing
- Clear distinction between supervisor and branch contexts
- Seamless switching between all sessions
- No confusion with branches named "master"
