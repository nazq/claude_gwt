### Creating a New Feature Branch

```
Human: I need to work on a new authentication feature. Can you create a branch and worktree for it?

Claude: I'll create a new branch and worktree for your authentication feature.

[Uses create_worktree tool with branch: "feature-authentication", createBranch: true]

I've created a new worktree for the feature-authentication branch. The worktree is located at:
/home/user/project/feature-authentication

Would you like me to launch Claude in this new worktree so you can start working on it?
