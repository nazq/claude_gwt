Git Branch Manager with Claude Code Orchestration    <-- UPDATED
v1.0.0
```

## Summary of Changes

1. **Terminology**: All references to "worktrees" in user-facing text have been changed to "branches"
2. **New Feature**: Added "📋 List all branches" option in the main menu
3. **Improved Clarity**: Users now see familiar "branch" terminology instead of the technical "worktree" term
4. **Consistent Experience**: The tool still uses git worktrees under the hood but presents them as branches to users

The implementation preserves all the technical functionality while making the interface more intuitive for users who understand Git branches but may not be familiar with worktrees.
