# Coverage Status Report - recommended-coverage-95 Branch

## Current Status

### Test Results
- **Total Tests**: 922 tests
- **Passing**: 918 tests
- **Failing**: 4 tests (all in cgwt-program-guided-experience.test.ts and GitRepository.test.ts)

### Coverage Metrics
- **Overall Coverage**: 34.76% (statements)
- **Target**: 95%
- **Gap**: 60.24%

## Files Improved So Far

### 1. Logger (src/core/utils/logger.ts)
- **Current Coverage**: 61.14%
- **Improvements Made**:
  - Fixed test mocking issues
  - Added tests for error paths
  - Added tests for development prettifiers
  - Fixed gitignore modification test

### 2. Security Utils (src/core/utils/security.ts)
- **Current Coverage**: 37.03%
- **Improvements Made**:
  - Fixed isValidBranchName bug (now rejects any branch containing ".lock")
  - Added property-based tests
  - Added tests for edge cases

### 3. Additional Coverage Tests
- Created comprehensive test suite for uncovered utility functions
- Added tests for type guards, security utilities

### 4. Architecture Refactoring
- Created ClaudeGWTApp.refactored.ts with full dependency injection
- Created comprehensive test suite achieving 89.24% coverage for the refactored file
- Created interfaces.ts for all dependencies

## Major Issues Preventing 95% Coverage

### 1. Low Coverage Files Not Yet Addressed
- **WorktreeManager.ts**: 4.84% coverage (needs ~160 lines covered)
- **prompts.ts**: 10.63% coverage (needs UI interaction tests)
- **ClaudeGWTApp.ts**: 14.26% coverage (original file, not the refactored version)
- **ConfigManager.ts**: 15.08% coverage (needs ~365 lines covered)
- **TmuxEnhancer.ts**: 18.08% coverage
- **GitRepository.ts**: 19.77% coverage

### 2. Integration vs Unit Test Coverage
The codebase has many integration tests but coverage tools are only measuring unit test coverage. Many files are well-tested in integration tests but show low unit test coverage.

### 3. UI and Interactive Components
Files like prompts.ts, spinner.ts, and banner.ts are difficult to unit test due to their interactive nature.

## Recommendations to Reach 95%

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Est. +20% coverage)
1. **Complete WorktreeManager tests** - This is mostly untested and would add significant coverage
2. **Add ConfigManager tests** - Large file with minimal coverage
3. **Integrate refactored ClaudeGWTApp** - Replace original with refactored version

### Phase 2: Medium Effort (Est. +25% coverage)
1. **Mock interactive prompts** - Create comprehensive mocks for inquirer
2. **Add TmuxEnhancer tests** - Mock tmux operations
3. **Complete GitRepository tests** - Add tests for all methods

### Phase 3: High Effort (Est. +15% coverage)
1. **Test error scenarios comprehensively** - Every catch block needs coverage
2. **Add tests for CLI commands** - SplitCommand, TipsCommand
3. **Test async operations** - Retry logic, timeouts, race conditions

## Realistic Assessment

**Can we reach 95% coverage?**
- **Technically possible**: Yes, with significant effort
- **Time required**: 2-3 days of focused work
- **Complexity**: High - requires mocking complex interactions

**Should we aim for 95% coverage?**
- Many files have good integration test coverage not reflected in unit test metrics
- Some files (UI components) provide limited value when unit tested
- A more realistic target might be 75-80% with focus on critical business logic

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Fix the 4 remaining test failures
2. Add comprehensive tests for WorktreeManager (biggest impact)
3. Add tests for ConfigManager
4. Integrate the refactored ClaudeGWTApp to replace the original

This would likely bring coverage to ~60-70% with reasonable effort.
